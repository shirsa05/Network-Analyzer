In today’s increasingly connected digital landscape, managing and securing local networks
is of critical importance. The Network Analyzer project is a real-time, web-based
utility application that allows users to scan their local network, identify connected
devices, assess latency, detect open ports and services, and identify potential vulnerabil-
ities.

It provides an interactive user interface through which users can initiate a network
scan and receive live updates about scan progress and results. The tool is ideal for IT
professionals, students, or home users wanting a quick and informative look into their
network environment.

Technologies Used

• Socket.IO – For real-time frontend-backend communication.
• Nmap – Network scanning and OS fingerprinting.
• Netifaces – To identify local network configuration.
